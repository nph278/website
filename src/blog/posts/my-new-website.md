This is my new website! Build with [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and [sass (SCSS)](https://sass-lang.com/).

I write the pages in markdown, and the layouts in [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html).

For syntax highlighting, I am using [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/).

Here's some code:

```js
const hi = () => {
  console.log("Yay!");
};
```
